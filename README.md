# ChargingCostModeling
This is the code that I used for Modelling Electric Vehicle Charging Prices, the purpose of which was to create a model that takes various input metrics and outputs a
price of charging. There are sample models for California and the USA included in CA_model.sav and USA_model.sav, and it should be possible to use your own datasets 
with this code by simply changing the paths in the import statements to create a new model as well.
