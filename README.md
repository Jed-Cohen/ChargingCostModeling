# ChargingCostModeling
This is the code that I used for Modelling Electric Vehicle Charging Prices, the purpose of which was to create a model that takes various input metrics and outputs a
price of charging. There are sample models for California and the USA included in CA_model.sav and USA_model.sav, and it should be possible to use your own datasets 
with this code by simply changing the paths in the import statements to create a new model as well. All of the Data besides the EV registration data for California 
can also be found here, but it is too big to fit. This data can be downloaded from EV hub https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/state-ev-registration-data/
